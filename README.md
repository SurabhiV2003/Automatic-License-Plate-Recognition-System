# Automatic-License-Plate-Recognition-System
## ABSTRACT
Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) systems have gained significant attention in recent years due to their wide range of applications in law enforcement, traffic management, and security surveillance. In this work we introduces an Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) system leveraging EasyOCR and YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithms. The proposed system integrates EasyOCR for optical character recognition (OCR) and YOLO for license plate detection, utilizing the efficiency and accuracy of these technologies. The YOLO algorithm enables real-time license plate detection by dividing the image into grid cells and predicting bounding boxes and class probabilities simultaneously. EasyOCR, on the other hand, excels in text recognition tasks, accurately extracting characters from license plate regions detected by YOLO. The combined system offers robust performance in handling variations in lighting conditions, occlusions, and non-standard license plate formats. Furthermore, the integration of these technologies enhances the system's adaptability and scalability, making it suitable for deployment in diverse environments. The paper discusses the implementation details, performance evaluation, and potential applications of the proposed ALPR system, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness in automating license plate recognition tasks
